* To make a release:

increment version number. Currently the version number is hard-coded in
the following locations:
./doc/conf.py
./setup.py
./skfmm/__init__.py
./README.txt

git tag v0.0.n
git push --tags origin master

make html
python setup.py upload_docs --upload-dir build/html

python setup.py sdist upload register

on a windows machine:
python setup.py bdist_wininst register upload


* Cython Wrapper for heap class

The binary min heap C++ class has a Cython wrapper to expose it to
Python. Cython is not required to build this module as the c++ files
created by Cython are checked into the git repo. If changes are made
to skfmm/heap.h or skfmm/heap.cpp the Cython c++ file pheap.cpp needs
to be updated. This is done with the command:

cython --cplus pheap.pyx

The updates pheap.cpp should also be checked into the git repo
